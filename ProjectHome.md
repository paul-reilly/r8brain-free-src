## Introduction ##
Open source (under the MIT license) high-quality professional audio sample rate converter (SRC) (resampling) library.  Features routines for SRC, both up- and downsampling, to/from any sample rate, including non-integer sample rates: it can be also used for conversion to/from SACD sample rate and even go beyond that.  SRC routines were implemented in multi-platform C++ code, and have a high level of optimality.
